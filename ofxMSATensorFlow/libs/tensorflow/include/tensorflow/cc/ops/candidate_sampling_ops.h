// These add a node to the graph from opts.

// Generates labels for candidate sampling with a learned unigram distribution.
//
// See explanations of candidate sampling and the data formats at
// go/candidate-sampling.
//
// For each batch, this op picks a single set of sampled candidate labels.
//
// The advantages of sampling candidates per-batch are simplicity and the
// possibility of efficient dense matrix multiplication. The disadvantage is that
// the sampled candidates must be chosen independently of the context and of the
// true labels.
//
// Arguments:
// * true_classes: A batch_size * num_true matrix, in which each row contains the
// IDs of the num_true target_classes in the corresponding original label.
// * num_true: Number of true labels per context.
// * num_sampled: Number of candidates to produce per batch.
// * unique: If unique is true, we sample with rejection, so that all sampled
// candidates in a batch are unique. This requires some approximation to
// estimate the post-rejection sampling probabilities.
// * opts:
//   .WithAttr("seed", int64): Defaults to 0.
//     If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero, the random number
// generator is seeded by the given seed.  Otherwise, it is seeded by a
// random seed.
//   .WithAttr("seed2", int64): Defaults to 0.

//
// Returns a pointer to the created Node, with outputs:
// * sampled_candidates: A vector of length num_sampled, in which each element is
// the ID of a sampled candidate.
// * true_expected_count: A batch_size * num_true matrix, representing
// the number of times each candidate is expected to occur in a batch
// of sampled candidates. If unique=true, then this is a probability.
// * sampled_expected_count: A vector of length num_sampled, for each sampled
// candidate representing the number of times the candidate is expected
// to occur in a batch of sampled candidates.  If unique=true, then this is a

// Generates labels for candidate sampling with a learned unigram distribution.
//
// A unigram sampler could use a fixed unigram distribution read from a
// file or passed in as an in-memory array instead of building up the distribution
// from data on the fly. There is also an option to skew the distribution by
// applying a distortion power to the weights.
//
// The vocabulary file should be in CSV-like format, with the last field
// being the weight associated with the word.
//
// For each batch, this op picks a single set of sampled candidate labels.
//
// The advantages of sampling candidates per-batch are simplicity and the
// possibility of efficient dense matrix multiplication. The disadvantage is that
// the sampled candidates must be chosen independently of the context and of the
// true labels.
//
// Arguments:
// * true_classes: A batch_size * num_true matrix, in which each row contains the
// IDs of the num_true target_classes in the corresponding original label.
// * num_true: Number of true labels per context.
// * num_sampled: Number of candidates to randomly sample per batch.
// * unique: If unique is true, we sample with rejection, so that all sampled
// candidates in a batch are unique. This requires some approximation to
// estimate the post-rejection sampling probabilities.
// * range_max: The sampler will sample integers from the interval [0, range_max).
// * opts:
//   .WithAttr("vocab_file", StringPiece): Defaults to "".
//     Each valid line in this file (which should have a CSV-like format)
// corresponds to a valid word ID. IDs are in sequential order, starting from
// num_reserved_ids. The last entry in each line is expected to be a value
// corresponding to the count or relative probability. Exactly one of vocab_file
// and unigrams needs to be passed to this op.
//   .WithAttr("distortion", float): Defaults to 1.
//     The distortion is used to skew the unigram probability distribution.
// Each weight is first raised to the distortion's power before adding to the
// internal unigram distribution. As a result, distortion = 1.0 gives regular
// unigram sampling (as defined by the vocab file), and distortion = 0.0 gives
// a uniform distribution.
//   .WithAttr("num_reserved_ids", int64): Defaults to 0.
//     Optionally some reserved IDs can be added in the range [0,
// ..., num_reserved_ids) by the users. One use case is that a special unknown
// word token is used as ID 0. These IDs will have a sampling probability of 0.
//   .WithAttr("num_shards", int64): Defaults to 1.
//     A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range
// in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This parameter
// (together with 'shard') indicates the number of partitions that are being
// used in the overall computation.
//   .WithAttr("shard", int64): Defaults to 0.
//     A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range
// in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This parameter
// (together with 'num_shards') indicates the particular partition number of a
// sampler op, when partitioning is being used.
//   .WithAttr("unigrams", gtl::ArraySlice<float>): Defaults to [].
//     A list of unigram counts or probabilities, one per ID in sequential
// order. Exactly one of vocab_file and unigrams should be passed to this op.
//   .WithAttr("seed", int64): Defaults to 0.
//     If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero, the random number
// generator is seeded by the given seed.  Otherwise, it is seeded by a
