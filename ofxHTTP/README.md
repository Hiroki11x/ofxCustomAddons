ofxHTTP
=======

ofxHTTP is designed to work best using Project Generator.

ofxHTTP master branch is tested with the latest release of openFrameworks. The develop branch attempts to stay up to date with the latest openFrameworks development branch.  For previous releases, check here https://github.com/bakercp/ofxHTTP/releases.

NOTE: Requires the following addons:

- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO
- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxMediaType
- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxSSLManager
- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxTaskQueue
- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxNetworkUtils

Some examples require:

- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxJSON

This is the second development release.  The web socket examples have been removed and users are encouraged to use the https://github.com/bakercp/ofxJSONRPC examples instead.  They are much more useful.

A suite of HTTP tools in pure POCO, Web Server, Web Client, etc.


Other notes:

## Clients
- Clients work best with up-to-date CA Certificate bundles.  An fairly recent example is included in the ofxHTTP client examples.  For up-to-date certificates (or if you just want to generate your own for security reasons), check out this page for more info: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

## Servers
If your server serves up files that are downloaded by the browser rather than displayed, make sure you have a mime.types file defined in your data folder like this https://github.com/bakercp/ofxHTTP/tree/master/example_basic_file_server/bin/data/media

All web servers can be run from the cloud.  To run the examples, download openFrameworks onto the server.  Usually you will download a Linux64 build and will do this over ssh while connected to your web host.  Then build the core library according to the linux tutorials.  Then make sure that your security settings ("Security Groups" on Amazon EC2) allow incoming connections on the your chosen server ports (the default is 8080).  So, for port 8080, you would allow inbound connections from `8080	0.0.0.0/0`.  Then launch the server with `make && make run` to build and run it the server.  It is up to you to figure out the best way to enable the server at system startup and keep the server running if there are any crashes.  Enjoy!

## Compatibility
This addon requires openFrameworks 0.9.1+.
